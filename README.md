# Final Rush
Created by Ted Green | 5/11/17

This is my final project for my CSC-303: Intro to Game-Design Course

## Overview
The goal of the game is to guide a small ship in space across a mini obstacle course under a time limit Failure to do so will result in a game over.

Additionally, touching any of the walls will send the ship back to the beginning, and with no easy way to stop momentum, it can be tricky to navigate the course. but those who complete the 5 different levels in this game will win eternal glory!... or something similar.

###Controls

W = Move Up
S = Move Down
A = Move Left
D = Move Right
Space = Action (at title screen)


###Demo
We have a (very) basic demo available online - [Play Here!](https://tedgreen38.github.io/csc303-2dplatformer-finalproject)
